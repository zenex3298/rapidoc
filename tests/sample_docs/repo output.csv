,10/6,11/21,"No longer on Board of Inlet but was then decided time to get off. She did various things on Board, No reason she left, she had no training on board",,
,11/22,12/20,"Board approval was always required while she was there she handled maybe 4. Approval process was an application was received.  They read it, some would do an internet search, you would definitely check references and then an interview was set up and then you vote. The vote is informal . The interview is informal. Usually after the interview. ",,
,12/21,13/12,Board holds meetings.  The meetings are noticed. The vote does not take place at these meetings but after the interview. In her time there was always an interview until Mr. Mott. He is the only one that did not get an interview. ,,
,13/13,13/23,It was up to indiv board members to perform an investigation.  She never did. She also did not for Mott. ,,
,14/1,14/16,She went through a process when she bought.  When on Board she would check references if asked.  She doesn't know if Board always checked references. She did not check references for Mott. She doesn't know if application got that far.  She had no duties in that application process.,,
,14/17,14/25,The contract is sent to Pres of the Board (Ron Early) and the application and he disburses it to the rest of the Board.  Then you may or may not be asked to check a reference and then you are asked to be part of the interview and then you are asked for a vote. ,,
,15/1,16/24,"For Mott's application, nothing was asked of her. She did not review anything.  She saw his application and some emails about concerns.  Nothing stood out to her about his application.  She had no questions about any information on his application.  Based on his application, she believed he was a fit buyer. There were some emails about missing parts of the contract and concerns about his disbarment. She did not review or do anything else.  The emails raised concerns with her becuase she knew he had been disbarred. She did not look into it further. It was a busy time.",,
,16/25,17/25,She doesn't believe she had any conversations with anyone on the Board about it.  She was waiting to get more information. She later got more information. She got confirmation it was that Geoffrey Mott. There were a few more emails trying to get advice of counsel as to how to proceed.She thinks they eventually got an opinion of counsel.  She believes she got an opinion that they had  a right to deny.,,
,18/6,18/17,She believes they got advice from counsel in Mid February before thedenial letter was issued. Then she said she doesn’t know if before or after. She was a party to the communication meeting with counsel re how to proceed. ,,
,18/18,19/7,Board meetings are held usually once a month.  She doesn't recall not having a meeting once a month.  There was a two week notice. They are told of the date through email or discussion and then its posted for all of the residents at least two weeks before the meeting. Before COVID they were in the Board room. After via Zoom. ,,
,19/8,20/17,"Minutes are kept of all meetings.  They are prepared by secretary Roger Brinner. She did not know process. The notes are taken at the meeting. She usually gets them before they are final. The members get them to review in case corrections are needed. They are sent out via email. Some may be mailed. They are not ""terrible detailed"". If there was a vote she believes it would be included in the minutes.  ",,
,20/18,22/5,As long as she's been on the Board no one ever been denied other than Mott. Members are advised of Board decision. The Board must operate in good faith and can deny without cause. They cannot deny for race or religion or disability she doesn't think so.  The Board can't discriminate. She thinks the Board might deny because someone might not be a good neighbor.,,
,22/7,22/25,"The applicant might not be a good neighbor - it’s a bit more complicated than that.  Mr. Mott had been disbarred, had been abusive to his clients and co-workers and that would not seem to be a good fit to be part of a healthy community in a small condo building where people live in close proximity to each other. She dosn't know why not a good reason to tell him why being denied. ",,
,23/2,24/4,"This information about Mott, she didn't look into it herself, she learned of this information through emails. She did not look into it before Mr. Mott was denied. She read some things after. She read about the disbarment. She learned he'd been disbarred,he'd improperly used money that was to be put in an escrow fund, that he had been abusive to co-workers and to clients.  She read of variety of things she doesn't know which document(s).",,
,24/5,24/15,She learned he was reinstated. She recently had learned he was suffering from a disability at the time of his bar proceedings. She didn't know that before. She didn't review anything those documents she was talking about before the issuance of the denial. ,,
,24/16,26/3,"She knows David Gury. She knew him since he moved in. He was Pres before she was on board. When she was on board it was her, Ron Early, Bob Cullen, Roger Brinner and Doug Sabra.  Anne McCarthy replaced her.  That was March 27th.  There are 30 units in the building.  1 is occupied by the Superintendent. She knows most of unit owners none that she does not have a good relationship. She occassionally socializes with members of the board. She doesn't think she ever had dinner but was friendly with Gury. ",,
,26/4,26/20,She does not know Andrea Chang. She does not know Cuppy Kraft. She interacted with no agents re 304. She did not see any emails re communications with agents.  She learned Gury's unit was for sale.  Around Decmeber 2022 Bob Cullen called and told her. ,,
,26/21,29/1,She learned Mott was under contract to purchase the Unit. She thinks in early February. She was on the board and got an email that it was under contract. She got a copy of the Contract around first week of February. She did not discuss with anyone. Around that time she did not receive a second contract.  She does not recall another contract.  She thinks she did not see another contract until after a decision was made to deny Mr. Mott. At some point she saw two contracts.  one she doesn't know who and the other Souaid. She does not recall any board member having any preference.  ,,
,29/2,29/18,At some point she reviewed Mott's application.  But she did not call references.  She doesn't know if anyone on Board did. She had no contact with Mr. Mott. She had no communications with Gury. She doesn't know if anyone else did. ,,
,29/19,31/23,At some point there was a denial issued of Mr. Mott. She believes Ron Early prepared it.  She said it was the Board's decision to issue the denial There was a meeting held.  She doesn't recall when but around the second week of February she thinks. It as a meeting not noticed to the entire community just to the board members. She believes minutes were taken. She doesn't know if attorney was present. They were in Executive Session. She does not think an attorney was present. They decided at that point to seek legal counsel how to proceed. She can't remember if the final decision was made then or not. She doesn't recall if there was a vote taken at that meeting. There was the decision to seek advice of an attorney. ,,
,31/24,32/16,"After that point in time, attorney advice was sought. Then there was a meeting with the attorney present. She thinks Mid-February best guess. She doesn't know if before or after denial of Mott. They were working through it. ",,
,34/5,35/15,Seeing the 2/13/23 Minutes. Those are the minutes from the regular board meeting in February. Then the Executive Session Minutes. This was the document she alluded to. She acknowledged there was no vote taken. ,,x
,35/16,36/22,"Showing her the denial.  She does not recall the document. It was on 2/15/23, 2 days after the Exec Session. She does not recall any intervening meetings. She not recall any intervening votes. She did not review the bar decision before the denial. ",,
,36/22,39/21,She saw after the denial about Mr. Mott's disability. Before that there was never any discussion about his mental status or disability. She never questioned or had issues with issuance of the denial. She has no issue in hindsight having denied him and then learning about his disability bc she believes his actions prove he would not be a good neighbor like filing a lawsuit. She feels issues of trust and responsiblity.  She was not aware of his disability when she voted to deny his application.  ,,
,39/22,40/24,She doesn’t recall if discussed with any Board Members or residents. She did not discuss with Gury. She thinks Early spoke to Gury. She doesn't know anything about that conversation. He was denied without cause.,,
,41/18,42/5,In Mott's case there was one document and then she thinks there was a a form on why he was disbarred that came from Ron Early. It talked about why he had been disbarred ,,
,42/6,44/18,Reqts for issuing a denial without cause. The Board has to find a second buyer within 30 days. She doesn't recall if Board discussed that. She does not recall meetings. They have never had to do that before. She believes the Board contacted Andrea Chang when they learned there were other interested parties. She was not involved in that at all. They got aFilshtinski contract she doesn't recall when. Some search was performed on him. Not sure if application got far enough for interview.  He was not approved.  ,,
,44/19,47/5,She knows the name Souaid and met them in the interview. They applied she did not Google them. She doesn't know if a Google search was performed. She saw the application and was part of the interview. Maybe at end of Feb. They were approved as Buyers. She met them at interview. She didn't know which side Andrea Chang worked for.  She assumes that the Souaids were introduced to the Board by Chang.  She recalls seeing a contract but not sure how it came to be. They did not close. ,,
,47/6,48/11,"Since there were not approved, if not approved the first buyer receives the property but in this case there was legal maneuvering to make that happen. She doesn't think that's appropriate. She thinks the lawsuit is what she means. It is her understanding the first buyer would be approved but in this case the first buyer prevented the closing. She was unaware the Souaid's had contract language allowign them to cancel. She did not know the Souaids canceled their contract.  ",,
,49/21,51/3,She was not involved with Board when Souaid terminated their contract. She think's Mott's application was received 2/11 because the Super Bowl was the next day. Received email from Early .  ,,
,51/4,53/19,She does not recall there being anything waiting from Mr. Gury.  To initiate the process the Board just needs an application and an approval.  They were received before the rejection.  Gury was not required to make a personal appearance. She doesn't know if Board discussed disbarment with Gury. She did not. She says she made their discussion based on legal counsel and felt they had the right to do what they did.   They knew litigation was a risk but felt they had the right to go forward. ,,
,54/8,55/3,Filshtinski application not automatically approved by Mott's rejection.  The Board did not approve Filshtinski.She thinks there were contingencies that had to be met. She doesn't know what or why.  ,,
,55/4,56/13,From what she knows the Association's effort to provide a substitute purchaser was to contact Andrea Chang to find out who the backup buyers were. That was the Souaids. She doesn't know if they discussed exposure to Gury. He was a friend. They had sympathy for Dave but felt they had a backup buyer,,
